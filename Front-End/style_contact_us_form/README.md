# Project Exercise 5: Style Your Form  

This repository contains the 5th exercise from the Fullstack Web Development AI Cohort. In this lesson, the **Contact Us** form was styled using CSS to improve its appearance and interactivity. Various effects like `pseudo-classes` were applied to form elements. `Smooth transitions` and slight `transformations` were added to enhance user experience.
