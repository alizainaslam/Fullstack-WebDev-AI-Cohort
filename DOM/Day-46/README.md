# Chapter 46 - Array of Objects & Event Bubbling/Capturing ðŸš€

In this chapter, I explored how to work with **arrays of objects** in JavaScript and how **event bubbling/capturing** works inside the DOM.

### ðŸ’¡ Features / Topics Covered:

- **Using Array of Objects:**  
  Created an array of job objects and used it to dynamically render job cards with company logo, role, pay, and background colors.  
- **Dynamic Job Cards:**  
  Rendered multiple job cards by looping through the array and inserting content into the DOM.  
- **Event Bubbling/Capturing:**  
  Practiced how events propagate from child elements to parent elements and how to handle them efficiently.

### ðŸ§  What I Learned:

- How to structure and use arrays of objects to dynamically generate HTML  
- Inserting dynamic content into the DOM using JavaScript  
- Handling events using event bubbling for cleaner, scalable code
